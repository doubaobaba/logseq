## Abstract

The B2C retail e-commerce logistics center is constantly developing towards the intelligence and unmanned direction. In the automatic packaging, there are problems of low efficiency and low utilization of box volume caused by packing algorithm. The current common spatial analysis algorithm and three-dimensional packing algorithm and so on are analyzed. Based on the above analysis and combined with the order characteristics of retail e-commerce, a three-dimensional packing model of multi-box with multi-commodity is established. Hybrid Genetic Algorithm and MATLAB are used to solve the model and its solution method are verified by a retail e-commerce data.
