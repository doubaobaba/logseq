## Abstract

Cloth simulation is a significant technique of physical animation, which can produce realistic cloth animation. However, previous methods scarcely generate convincing garment animation in real time, and require much numerical calculation. In this paper, we introduce an original algorithm, which reduces requisite simulation springs by half, guarantees expeditious numerical evaluation. The Verlet integration is used for describing kinetic springs which are substructures of deformable objects. After that, we do the collision handling by AABB collision detection and response. Finally handled quantitative data of garment and virtual character animation are delivered to rendering pipeline for displaying. This system provides corresponding APIs which offer distinct geometry simplification methods and collision properties. It is convenient for users to adjust environment parameters and observe rendering effects. Our method is efficacious and straightforward to achieve acceptable simulation effects without complex processing.
